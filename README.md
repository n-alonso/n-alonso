### Hi, I am Nick! 👋
I am Nicolas Alonso and programming have been my dream job since I can remember.  
For a long time I thought it was out of my reach but when I moved to Lithuania the gates opened and I've been pursuing this dream ever since!

### Quick info ⚡
- 💪 I am most experienced in the backend, mostly with Node.js but a bit of Dotnet and Java as well.
- 💼 Also like DevOps with Linux, Bash, Docker, CI/CD and some AWS and OpenShift/Kubernetes basics.
- 📚 Currently learning frontend with React.
- ✉️ The best way to reach me is through my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolas-alonso-11853017a/).

### Portfolio
If you want to have a look at my **backend** or **frontend** work, you can check my [Progress Tracker](https://github.com/n-alonso/progress-tracker)!  
For **devops** I have a [CI Catalog](https://github.com/n-alonso/ci-catalog) as a small example

### Activity
There are long absent periods in my activity feed but mostly due to it happening at my work account.  
Here is a sneak peak at the activity of my work account at the time of writing:
